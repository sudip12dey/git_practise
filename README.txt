I love Gayathri Bubu.
Hope I get my PhD with a full funding soon.
I want to return back to my work with Biostimulants and evaluating their actions in imparting stress tolerance to plants.
Delineating gene expression profiles in host plants.
Further, I can improve my basic skills in Molecular Biology nd developing assays.
